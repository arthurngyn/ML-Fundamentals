I want to see the relationship between danceability and popularity during 2010 - 2020. 
My hypothesis is that there will be a relationship due to the rise of apps like musically, instagram, and the power of the general internet. 

So i'll start by plotting these relationships 


Okay i've created the best fit line and plotted all the data and got all the coefficients; 

Turns out there is no correlation as I get a coefficient of determination of -0.04 to -0.05 
Therefore the mean squared error is super off and the line of best fit can't predict accurately 

The plots I have are basically horizontal lines; 

Linear Regression makes a lot of sense now especially after take multivar calc.
