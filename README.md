# Mastering Machine Learning Fundamentals

This repository documents my journey in mastering the fundamentals of Machine Learning (ML). Here, I will share my progress, projects, notes, and resources as I dive deeper into understanding the core principles and applications of ML.

## Goals
- Develop a strong foundation in ML concepts, including supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Gain hands-on experience with popular ML frameworks and tools (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Work through fundamental ML problems and datasets.
- Document key takeaways and challenges along the way.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks exploring different ML concepts and techniques. Each notebook is labeled by topic.
- **Projects/**: End-to-end mini-projects applying ML techniques to solve real-world problems.
- **Resources/**: Curated list of books, articles, and online courses.
- **Notes/**: Key takeaways and summaries from various learning materials.
- **Datasets/**: Sample datasets used for experiments and exercises.
